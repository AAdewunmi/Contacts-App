# Contacts App (Work in Progress)

A simple contacts manager under active development. This project is currently focused on setting up tooling and basic scaffolding; features will land incrementally.

## Getting Started

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18+ (developed with Node 24) and npm
- macOS users: Xcode Command Line Tools installed (needed for native modules like `deasync`)

Setup:
```bash
npm install
```

Development (when an entry file is added, e.g., `src/index.html`):
```bash
npx parcel <entry-file>
```

## Scripts
- `npm test` — placeholder; no tests yet.

## Testing
- No automated tests are present yet. When tests are added, run `npm test`.
- Consider adding unit tests (e.g., Jest or Vitest) once core features are implemented.

## Project Status
- Parcel v1 is installed (`parcel-bundler@1.12.x`), though migration to Parcel v2 is recommended later.
- Application features and UI are not yet implemented.
